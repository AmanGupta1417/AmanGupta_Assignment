**Word Count Histogram**

This is a React web application that fetches the contents of a text file from a remote server and generates a histogram of the 20 most occurring words in the text. The application also provides an "Export" button that allows the user to download a CSV file of the histogram data.

**Usage:**

Click on the "Submit" button to fetch the text file from the remote server and generate the histogram.

If the histogram is successfully generated, you can view it on the screen along with the "Export" button.

Click on the "Export" button to download the histogram data in CSV format.
