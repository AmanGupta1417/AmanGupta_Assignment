**Word Count Histogram**

This is a React web application that fetches the contents of a text file from a remote server and generates a histogram of the 20 most occurring words in the text. The application also provides an "Export" button that allows the user to download a CSV file of the histogram data.


**Components**

The application consists of two main components:

1. App.js - This is the main React component that handles the fetching of the text file, word counting, and rendering of the histogram and export button.
2. App.css - This is the CSS file that styles the application and adds animations to make it more visually appealing.


**Libraries and Plugins Used**


The following libraries and plugins were used to build this application:

1. React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. Chart.js - A JavaScript library for creating charts and graphs.
3. eslint - A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
4. Prettier - A code formatter that ensures consistent styling and formatting across code files.


**Usage:**


Click on the "Submit" button to fetch the text file from the remote server and generate the histogram.

If the histogram is successfully generated, you can view it on the screen along with the "Export" button.

Click on the "Export" button to download the histogram data in CSV format.


**Built With:**


React - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Chart.js - JavaScript charting library.
